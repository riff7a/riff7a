- 👋 Hi, I’m @riff7a~
- 👀 I’m interested in network economics and game theory.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning MARL and other agent-based algorithms.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on social media anaylsis as well as some mechanism design about it.
- 📫 You are welcomed to reach me through my email rannit1025@gmail.com or fang376@purdue.edu.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I draw comics and posters for LGBTQ novels, movies and TV shows in my spare time, and have 20,000 followers on Weibo～
